# Electron

go to the directory demos\simple_electron

install electron pre build 

    npm install

The demo makes use of the standard web BLE support of chrome. You can also make use of noble. But this is more complex to install and windows support is limited. Chrome BLE is easier bug it needs an extra click for connecting to the device. (you can only connect to an blue tooth device when the end user clicks on an button to select the device.)

run the demo

    npm start
    
Optional: You can rebuild the javascipt from the type script by typing in the main folder.

    npm run build:simple_electron
